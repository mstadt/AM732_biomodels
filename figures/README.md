# Figures Details
We conducted numerical simulations of the model given on the main page of this code. Here are the captions for each of the figures by their file names. The simulation values are listed in the simulation_results folder.
- **Fig1zeta0.08** Deng model time series plot with zeta = 0.08
- **Fig1zeta0.1** Deng model time series plot with zeta = 0.1
- **Fig1zeta0.2** Deng model time series plot with zeta = 0.2
- **Fig1zeta0.3** Deng model time series plot with zeta = 0.3
- **myfig6a** Similar figure to Fig. 6a from Deng 2001
- **myfig6c** Similar figure to Fig. 6c from Deng 2001
- **myfig6d** Similar figure to Fig. 6d from Deng 2001
- **myfig6e** Similar figure to Fig. 6e from Deng 2001
- **myfig6f** Similar figure to Fig. 6f from Deng 2001
- **varyepsilon** model solution values for varied values of epsilon. This is shown for two values of delta_2. Note that smaller values of epsilon lead to numerical issues.


Here are any findings or details that we found interesting about these figures.
- From looking at how the Deng model changed over time with different values of zeta, we found that as zeta increased, the number of peaks over 100 seconds for the prey function decreased. For the predator function, this number decreased as well, and for the top predator function, the number increased. Using the number of peaks as an informal substitute for the period of the function, we can say that as zeta increases, the change in prey and the change in predator both decrease while the change in the top predator increases.
