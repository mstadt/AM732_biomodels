# Figures Details
We conducted numerical simulations of the model given on the main page of this code. Here are the captions for each of the figures by their file names. The simulation values are listed in the simulation_results folder.
- **Fig1xi0.1**
- **Fig1xi0.2**
- **Fig1xi0.3**
- **myfig6a**
- **myfig6c**
- **myfig6d**
- **myfig6e**
- **myfig6f**
- **varyepsilon** model solution values for varied values of epsilon. This is shown for two values of delta_2. Note that smaller values of epsilon lead to numerical issues.
