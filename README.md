# AM732_biomodels
These code files are used to explore the Rosenzweig-MacArthur food chain model as presented in Hek, JMB, 2010 for the AM 732 Fall 2022 group project for Amelia, Zara, and Melissa.

This is based on the model given in [Deng, 2001]([https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajprenal.00264.2021](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1396340)).

## modelcode.m
This script can be used to simulate the model.

### simulation_results/
This directory contains .mat files of simulation results used from modelcode.m with varied parameter values.
